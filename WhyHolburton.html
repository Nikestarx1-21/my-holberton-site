    <h1>Why Holberton?</h1>
    <p>
      Holberton's project-based, peer-driven model aligns perfectly with how I learn and grow best. 
      I'm ready to be challenged, to fail forward, and to develop real, practical skills. 
      I believe Holberton will not only teach me how to code â€” it will teach me how to think like a world-class software engineer.
